# Change Log
All notable changes are documented here.

## 1.10.16 (2025-09-04)
- Fix: Add fallback refresh for alarm state update by @shamoon in #462
- Bump brace-expansion from 1.1.11 to 1.1.12 by @dependabot[bot] in #463

## 1.10.15 (2025-04-13)
- This maintenance release contains dependency updates and security fixes and also notes compatibility with Homebridge v2.0

## 1.10.13 (2023-04-05)
- Fixes a change made by SimpliSafe that broke the ability of the plugin to maintain authentication. See [#386](https://github.com/homebridge-simplisafe3/homebridge-simplisafe3/issues/386). All users will need to re-authenticate.

## 1.10.12 (2023-03-15)
- Excluding cameras is now supported using the `excludedDevices` option. See #384.

## 1.10.11 (2022-11-18)
- Unfortunately, due to changes made by Simplisafe, this version reverts to using the 'manual' login process that requires the browser. This is unlikely to change going forward.

## 1.10.10 (2022-08-27)
- This release fixes a potential issue when logging in with command line interface if an incorrect path is given.

## 1.10.9 (2022-08-15)
- This release re-introduces the "automatic" login process (as of now SS have removed ReCAPTCHA). See #360 and #352
- Adds improvement to authentication failure detection, including on plugin startup. See #361

## 1.10.8 (2022-07-25)
- Unfortunately, due to changes made by Simplisafe, the plugin now uses the previous login method that uses the browser. See https://github.com/homebridge-simplisafe3/homebridge-simplisafe3/issues/352 / https://twitter.com/bachya/status/1550318909164748801
- This release fixes an issue that could cause re-authentication failures.

## 1.10.7 (2022-07-22)
- Reverts the plugin to the previous login method that uses the browser.

## 1.10.6 (2022-06-01)
- This release updates the ffmpeg tool bundled with the plugin and should resolve ffmpeg installation issues on M1 Macs, see https://github.com/homebridge/ffmpeg-for-homebridge/issues/44

## 1.10.5 (2022-05-18)
- This release adds support for SimpliSafe "Test mode" i.e. it no longer triggers a (false) alarm, see #341.

## 1.10.4 (2022-04-21)
- This release fixes an issue that prevented upgrading for some users, see #335.

## 1.10.3 (2022-04-14)
- This release updates a dependency used to install `ffmpeg` which was not properly installing itself in previous versions.

## 1.10.2 (2022-04-08)
- This release brings "automatic" authorization, meaning you can just enter your SimpliSafe username and password using the UI or command line and the plug-in will take care of the rest! Supports SMS and email verification.
- Various fixes for authentication refresh failures.
- Lots of dependency updates.

## 1.9.11 (2022-03-11)
- Fixes (another) issue with subscription filtering. Thanks to @bigchrisatx for reporting.

- Other minor improvements to log output

## 1.9.9 (2022-03-03)
- This release implements a siginificant rewrite of the way the plugin receives 'real-time' events. The old method is expected to be deprecated soon. This change was tested as much as possible, thank you for your patience with this release. As always, consider taking a backup first. Please note that logging will be quite verbose if you have `debug` enabled.
- The `simplisafe3config.json` file and `resetSimpliSafeId` config option are no longer used.
